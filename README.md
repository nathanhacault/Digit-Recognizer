# Digit Recognizer
The Digit Recognizer is an application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to recognize hand-written digits. It leverages a dataset stored in CSV format, containing both training and testing data, to train and evaluate its models.


## Installation
Before proceeding with the installation please ensure that you have Python on your machine
To get started with the app, follow these steps:

Open the terminal and use the git clone command to download the remote GitHub repository to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/nathanhacault/Digit-Recognizer.git
```
It will create a new folder with the same name as the GitHub repository "Digit-Recognizer". All the project files and git data will be cloned into it.
